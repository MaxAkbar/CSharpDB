## Near-Term

Recently completed improvements to query performance, storage/runtime behavior, maintenance workflows, and developer ergonomics.

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **`DISTINCT` keyword** | Deduplicate rows in SELECT output | Done |
| **Composite indexes** | Multi-column indexes for covering more query patterns | Done |
| **Index range scans** | Use indexes for `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `BETWEEN` — not just equality | Done |
| **Prepared statement cache** | Cache parsed ASTs and query plans to avoid re-parsing identical SQL | Done |
| **Cached max rowid** | Avoid repeated O(n) scans when generating row IDs on insert (in-memory + persisted high-water mark) | Done |
| **B+tree delete rebalancing** | Merge underflowed pages on delete to reclaim space | Done |
| **In-memory database mode** | Open a database fully in memory, load a disk database into memory, and save a committed snapshot back to disk | Done |
| **Shared in-memory ADO.NET mode** | Support `Data Source=:memory:` and named shared in-memory databases with explicit save/load | Done |
| **Collection field indexes** | Equality-based secondary indexes for `Collection<T>` via `EnsureIndexAsync` / `FindByIndexAsync` | Done |
| **Reader session reuse** | Reuse snapshot pager and query planner inside `ReaderSession` for burst concurrent reads | Done |
| **Architecture enforcement** | `CSharpDB.Client` is now the main caller-facing interaction layer across local and remote scenarios, with direct engine-backed transport intentionally retained for in-process access | Done |
| **Database administration** | Maintenance report, reindex (database/table/index/collection), VACUUM/compact, fragmentation analysis, database size report | Done |
| **Dedicated gRPC daemon** | `CSharpDB.Daemon` host plus `CSharpDB.Client` gRPC coverage for SQL, schema, procedures, collections, and maintenance | Done |
| **Storage tuning presets** | `UseLookupOptimizedPreset()` and `UseWriteOptimizedPreset()` for file-backed workloads | Done |
| **Background WAL checkpointing** | Incremental/sliced auto-checkpointing to move work off the triggering commit | Done |
| **Table/index statistics** | ANALYZE command with persisted row counts, column NDV/min/max, stale tracking, and initial stats-guided index selection in the query planner | In progress |

---

## Mid-Term

SQL feature parity and ecosystem expansion.

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **User-defined functions** | Broader built-in scalar function registry (UPPER, ABS, COALESCE, etc.), user-registered C# functions, native plugin extensions | Planned |
| **Subqueries** | Scalar subqueries, `IN (SELECT ...)`, `EXISTS (SELECT ...)`, including correlated evaluation in `WHERE`, non-aggregate projection, and `UPDATE`/`DELETE` expressions | Done |
| **`UNION` / `INTERSECT` / `EXCEPT`** | Set operations across SELECT results, including use in top-level queries, views, and CTE query bodies | Done |
| **Window functions** | `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()` | Planned |
| **`DEFAULT` column values** | Allow default expressions in column definitions | Planned |
| **`CHECK` constraints** | Arbitrary expression-based constraints per column or per table | Planned |
| **Foreign key constraints** | `REFERENCES` with optional `ON DELETE CASCADE` | Planned |
| **Remote host consolidation** | Fold the current `CSharpDB.Api` REST/HTTP surface into `CSharpDB.Daemon` so one long-running server host can serve REST, gRPC, and future local transports from a shared warm `Database` instance | Planned |
| **Remote host security** | Add built-in authentication, authorization, and transport-security options for remote HTTP and gRPC access, including API keys, protected admin endpoints, and TLS/mTLS deployment support | Planned |
| **Daemon service packaging** | Package the existing `CSharpDB.Daemon` host as a persistent background service across systemd, Windows Service, and launchd | Planned |
| **Cross-platform deployment** | dotnet tool, self-contained binaries, Docker, Homebrew, winget, install scripts | Planned |
| **NuGet package** | Publish and maintain `CSharpDB.Engine`, `CSharpDB.Data`, `CSharpDB.Client`, and `CSharpDB.Primitives` as the primary NuGet packages | Done |
| **Connection pooling** | Pool `Database` instances behind `CSharpDbConnection` to amortize open/close cost | Done |
| **Admin dashboard improvements** | Richer SQL editor UX, query history, and deeper diagnostics beyond the current schema/procedure/storage tooling | In progress |
| **Visual query designer** | Classic Admin query builder with source canvas, join editing, design grid, SQL preview, and saved designer layouts | Done |
| **VS Code extension** | Schema explorer, SQL editor with IntelliSense, data browser, table designer, storage diagnostics | Done |

---

## Long-Term

Advanced features and fundamental architecture enhancements.

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Memory-mapped I/O (mmap)** | Replace `byte[]` page materialization on cache misses with mapped read views where safe to reduce copy and GC pressure | Planned |
| **Full-text search** | Inverted index with tokenization, stemming, and relevance ranking | Planned |
| **JSON path querying** | Query into JSON document fields in the Collection API (e.g., `$.address.city`) | Planned |
| **Advanced collection storage path** | Extend document storage beyond UTF-8 JSON payloads with direct binary hydration and richer expression/path indexes | Planned |
| **Page-level compression** | Compress cell content within pages to reduce I/O and storage | Planned |
| **At-rest encryption** | Encrypt database and WAL files with passphrase-based key management and explicit plaintext/encrypted migration/export paths | Research |
| **Cost-based query optimizer** | Statistics-driven join ordering and index selection (initial support via ANALYZE in Near-Term; advanced histograms and adaptive re-optimization here) | Planned |
| **Async I/O batching** | Group multiple page writes into fewer system calls during batch operations | Planned |
| **Group commit / deferred WAL flush** | Buffer committed WAL writes across transactions before flushing to improve auto-commit throughput | Planned |
| **Multi-writer support** | Allow concurrent write transactions (conflict detection + retry) | Research |
| **Replication / change feed** | Stream committed changes for read replicas or event-driven architectures | Research |
| **WebAssembly sandboxed UDFs** | Execute untrusted user-submitted functions in a WASM sandbox with resource limits (fuel, memory caps) via Wasmtime | Research |

## Current Limitations

These are known simplifications in the current implementation:

| Area | Limitation |
|------|-----------|
| **Functions** | Very limited scalar function surface today: built-in `TEXT(expr)` plus aggregate functions; no broader built-in function library or user-defined functions yet |
| **Query** | Scalar/`IN`/`EXISTS` subqueries are supported, including correlated cases in `WHERE`, non-aggregate projection, and `UPDATE`/`DELETE` expressions; correlated subqueries are not yet supported in `JOIN ON`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, or aggregate projections |
| **Query** | `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` are supported; `UNION ALL` is not implemented yet |
| **Query** | No window functions |
| **Schema** | No SQL `DEFAULT` column values, `CHECK` constraints, or foreign keys |
| **Indexes** | Equality lookups support current `INTEGER`/`TEXT` indexes, but ordered range-scan pushdown is still limited to single-column `INTEGER` index paths |
| **RowId** | Legacy table schemas without persisted high-water metadata may pay a one-time key scan on first insert |
| **Collections** | `FindByIndexAsync` supports declared field-equality lookups; `FindAsync` remains a full scan |
| **Collections** | No JSON-path querying or expression/path-based document indexes yet |
| **Networking** | The current shipping model still splits remote access between `CSharpDB.Api` for HTTP and `CSharpDB.Daemon` for gRPC; host consolidation plus named pipes remain planned and are not implemented yet |
| **Security** | Remote HTTP and gRPC deployment still rely on external network controls or front-end TLS termination; built-in authentication, authorization, and TLS/mTLS support are still planned |
| **Concurrency** | Single writer only (no multi-writer) |
| **Storage** | No page-level compression |
| **Storage** | No at-rest encryption for database/WAL files; on-disk storage is plaintext only |
| **Storage** | No mmap read path |
| **Query** | `ANALYZE`, `sys.table_stats`, and `sys.column_stats` exist, but range and join costing still lean on heuristics rather than broader statistics-driven estimation |
